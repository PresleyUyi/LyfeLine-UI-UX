# LyfeLine-UI-UX
This wireframe is a user interface design that I designed for my team student web application project.Lyfeline is a student-focused web application designed to support productivity and wellbeing. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the platform features a study streak tracker, budget planner, live bus timetable, and more. Our goal was to create an all-in-one tool to help students manage their daily routines effectively.
